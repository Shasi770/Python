        "  - In probability, a random variable is a function that assigns a numerical\n",
        "   value to each possible outcome of a random experiment.\n",
        "\n",
        "#2.What are the types of random variables?\n",
        "   There are two types of random variables:\n",
        "\n",
        "   1. Discrete Random Variable\n",

        "  -  Discrete distributions deal with variables that can only take on a finite\n",
        "     or countable number of values, like the number of heads when flipping a coin. Continuous distributions, on the other hand, describe variables that can take on any value within a given range, such as height or temperature.\n",
        "\n",
        "#4.What are probability distribution functions (PDF)?\n",
        "  - A probability distribution function (PDF) is a mathematical function that\n",

        "\n",
        "#5.How do cumulative distribution functions (CDF) differ from probability distribution functions (PDF)?\n",
        "  - The probability distribution function (PDF) gives the probability that a\n",
        "     random variable takes on a specific value, while the cumulative distribution function (CDF) gives the probability that a random variable is less than or equal to a certain value.\n",
        "\n",
        "#6.What is a discrete uniform distribution?\n",
        "  - A Discrete Uniform Distribution is a probability distribution where each    outcome is equally likely among a finite number of outcomes.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - If a random variable  X  can take on n distinct values, each with equal\n",

        "  - The key properties of a Bernoulli distribution are its binary nature\n",

        "\n",
        "#8.What is the binomial distribution, and how is it used in probability?\n",
        "  - The binomial distribution is a probability distribution that models the\n",
        "     likelihood of a certain number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials, where each trial has only two possible outcomes: success or failure. It's used to calculate probabilities in situations like coin tosses, multiple-choice questions, or quality control checks where each event has a binary outcome.\n",
        "\n",
        "#9.What is the Poisson distribution and where is it applied?\n",
        "  - The Poisson distribution is a discrete probability distribution that\n",
        "     describes the probability of a certain number of events occurring within a fixed interval of time or space, given that these events happen independently at a constant average rate. It's used to model situations where events are rare and occur randomly.\n",

        "   - A normal distribution, also known as a Gaussian distribution, is\n",
        "     characterized by its bell-shaped curve, symmetry, and the equality of mean, median, and mode. It's a continuous distribution, meaning values can fall anywhere within a given range.\n",

        "   - The standard normal distribution is a specific type of normal distribution\n",

        "   - The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is a fundamental concept in statistics  \n",
        "     that states that when you take a large enough sample from any population, the distribution of the sample means will be approximately normal, regardless of the original population's distribution. This theorem is critical because it allows statisticians to use the normal distribution for inferences, even when the underlying data is not normally distributed.\n",

        "   - The central limit theorem states that if you take sufficiently large\n",

        "   - Z-score is calculated by subtracting the mean from the data point and\n",

        "   - In statistics, a point estimate is a single value used to estimate an\n",

        "   - Confidence intervals in statistical analysis provide a range of plausible\n",

        "#21.What are the assumptions for applying the Central Limit Theorem?\n",
        "   - The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) has several key assumptions that need    to be met for it to hold true. These include: random sampling, independent samples, a sufficiently large sample size, and a finite variance of the population.\n",

        "#22.What is the concept of expected value in a probability distribution?\n",
        "   - The expected value in a probability distribution represents the average\n",
