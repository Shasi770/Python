        "\n",
        "5.  What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "     - The __del__ method in Python is known as the destructor method. It is\n",
        "       called automatically when an object is about to be destroyed, typically when there are no more references to the object.\n",
        "     - To clean up resources — like closing files, releasing network\n",

        "     - In Python, you can handle multiple exceptions by using multiple except\n",
        "       blocks within a try...except structure, allowing you to specify different handling mechanisms for various error types.\n",
        "\n",
        "     Here's a breakdown:-\n",
        "\n",
        "       - try Block: Encloses the code that might raise exceptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "       - except Blocks: Each except block catches a specific type of exception.\n",
        "\n",
        "       - Multiple except Blocks: You can have multiple except blocks to handle  different exceptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "       - Exception Handling: When an exception occurs within the try block,\n",
        "         Python checks each except block sequentially, and the first matching  except block is executed.\n",
        "\n",
        "       Example:\n",
        "             try:\n",
        "                x = int(\"abc\")\n",
        "                y = 10 / 0\n",
        "             except ValueError:\n",

        "\n",
        "         - Each except block handles a different error type.\n",
        "\n",
        "         - Python executes only the first matching except block.\n",
        "\n",
        "8.  What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
        "     - The with statement in Python is used for resource management, especially\n",
        "       when working with files. Its main purpose is to simplify file handling and ensure that resources like files are properly closed, even if an error occurs.\n",
        "\n",
        "9.  What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        "     - The difference between multithreading and multiprocessing in Python (or\n",
        "       in general):-\n",
        "\n",
        "        Multithreading:-\n",
        "         - Definition: Running multiple threads (smaller units of a process) within a single process.\n",
        "\n",
        "         - Purpose: Best for I/O-bound tasks (e.g., reading/writing files, web\n",
        "           scraping, waiting for user input).\n",
        "\n",
        "         - Threads share memory: Since all threads belong to the same process,\n",
        "           they share the same memory space.\n",
        "\n",
        "         - Lightweight: Less memory overhead, faster context switching.\n",
        "\n",
        "        - Python Limitation: Affects CPU-bound tasks due to the Global\n",
        "          interpreter Lock (GIL) — only one thread executes Python bytecode at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        "          Example use cases:\n",
        "\n",
        "          - Downloading multiple files from the internet.\n",
        "\n",
        "          - Reading from multiple files simultaneously.\n",

        "          - Purpose: Best for CPU-bound tasks (e.g., heavy computations, data\n",
        "            processing).\n",
        "\n",
        "        -  Processes are independent: They don’t share memory directly.\n",
        "\n",
        "        -  More overhead: Creating processes is heavier than threads, but\n",
        "           bypasses the GIL in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "         Example use cases:-\n",
        "          - Image or video processing.\n",

        "\n",
        "10.  What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
        "      - Logging offers significant advantages in program development and\n",
        "        management, primarily by enabling easier debugging, monitoring system health, and improving security. It also helps with performance optimization and compliance.\n",
        "\n",
        "11.  What is memory management in Python?\n",
        "      - In Python, memory management is handled automatically by the Python\n",
        "        interpreter using a private heap and mechanisms like reference counting and garbage collection, allowing developers to focus on code logic rather than memory allocation and deallocation.\n",
        "\n",
        "12.  What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        "      - In Python, exception handling involves using try, except, else, and\n",
        "        finally blocks to gracefully manage errors and prevent program crashes. The try block contains code that might raise an exception, the except block handles specific exceptions, the else block executes if no exception occurs, and the finally block always executes for cleanup.\n",
        "\n",
        "13.  Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        "      - Memory management is crucial in Python because it directly impacts\n",
        "        program performance, resource usage, and potential issues like memory leaks, ensuring efficient and stable application execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "14.  What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        "      - In exception handling, the try block contains code that might\n",
        "        potentially raise an error, while the except block handles the error if one occurs within the try block, allowing the program to continue running gracefully instead of crashing.\n",
        "\n",
        "15.  How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "      - Python's garbage collection system automatically manages memory by\n",

        "        \n",
        "        How it work:-\n",
        "\n",
        "       a. Reference Counting\n",
        "        - Every object in Python has a reference count, which tracks how many\n",
        "          references point to it.\n",
        "\n",
        "        - When the reference count drops to zero (i.e., no variable is using    the object), Python immediately deallocates the memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "     b. Garbage Collector for Cyclic References\n",
        "        - Some objects may refer to each other, forming a reference cycle (e.\n",
        "          g., A → B → A), and may never reach a reference count of zero.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "     a.Reference Cycles:\n",
        "\n",
        "      - Python uses reference counting and a cyclic garbage collector.\n",
        "\n",
        "      - When objects reference each other (like in mutual references), they\n",

        "\n",
        "     b.Memory Leaks:\n",
        "\n",
        "      - Long-lived objects (like those stored in global variables,  \n",

        "\n",
        "      - Happens when developers keep references to unused objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "     c.Memory Usage in Multi-threading:\n",
        "\n",
        "      - Python’s Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) limits true        multi-threading.\n",
        "\n",
        "       - Using threads for memory-intensive tasks may not free memory as\n",
        "         efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "     d.Inefficient Data Structures:\n",
        "\n",
        "       - Using memory-heavy structures like large lists of objects instead\n",
        "         of more efficient ones like generators, sets, or arrays can lead to unnecessary memory use.\n",
        "\n",
        "      e.Not Releasing Memory Immediately:\n",
        "\n",
        "         - The garbage collector doesn't always release memory right away.\n",
        "\n",
        "         - Memory held by C extensions, or large blocks allocated via the\n",
        "           memory allocator, may not be returned to the OS immediately.\n",
        "\n",
        "     f.Debugging Memory Issues:\n",

        "     - In Python, you can raise an exception manually using the raise\n",
        "       keyword followed by an exception class.\n",
        "\n",
        "     - This keyword allows you to throw an exception with a custom error\n",
        "       message. In our example, we define a function called divide() that takes two numbers as arguments and divides them\n",

        "        Key Reasons to Use Multithreading:\n",

        "        a.Improved Responsiveness (UI applications):\n",
        "\n",
        "        - In GUI apps, multithreading allows long-running tasks (like file\n",
        "          downloads) to run in the background while the UI remains responsive to user actions.\n",
        "\n",
        "        b.Parallelism for I/O-bound tasks:\n",
        "\n",
        "        - For operations like reading files, web scraping, or making API\n",
        "          calls, multithreading helps overlap I/O wait times, making programs run faster.\n",
        "\n",
        "        c.Efficient Resource Utilization:\n",
        "\n",
        "        - Threads share the same memory space, which reduces overhead\n",
        "          compared to creating new processes.\n",
        "\n",
        "        d.Faster Execution (in some cases):\n",
        "\n",
        "        - Though Python has a Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) that restricts\n",
        "          true parallel CPU execution, for I/O-bound tasks, multithreading is highly effective.\n",
        "\n",
        "        e.Better Program Structure:\n",
        "\n",
        "       - Separating concerns (e.g., one thread handles logging, another\n",
