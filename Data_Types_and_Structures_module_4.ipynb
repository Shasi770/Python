        "\n",
        "  - In Python, dictionaries are implemented using a data structure known as a\n",
        "     hash table, which allows for efficient storage and retrieval of data through key-value pairs. Here's how dictionaries manage data internally:​\n",
        "\n",
        " Hashing Keys:\n",
        "\n",
        "     When you insert a key-value pair into a dictionary, Python computes a hash value for the key using a built-in hash function. This hash value is an integer that uniquely represents the key's content and determines where the key-value pair will be stored within the hash table.​\n",
        "\n",
        " Structure of the Hash Table:\n",
        "\n",
        "     The hash table consists of an array of slots, commonly referred to as \"buckets.\" Each bucket can hold one key-value pair\n",
        "\n",
        " Handling Collisions:\n",
        "\n",
        "     A collision occurs when two different keys produce the same hash value, causing them to map to the same bucket. Python addresses collisions using a method called open addressing. In this approach, if the initially calculated bucket is occupied, the dictionary probes other buckets in a specific sequence to find an empty slot for the new key-value pair.​\n",
        "\n",
        " Dynamic Resizing:\n",
        "\n",
        "     To maintain performance, Python dictionaries dynamically resize as the number of stored items increases.\n",
        "\n",
        "     Key Order Preservation:Starting from Python 3.7, dictionaries maintain the insertion order of keys as part of their standard behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "#5. Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "   - ​In Python, a set and a list depends on the specific requirements of your\n",
        "     program. Here are some scenarios where using a set might be more appropriate than a list:​\n",
        "\n",
        "  1.Ensuring Unique Elements:-\n",
        "\n",
        "     Sets automatically eliminate duplicate values, ensuring that all elements are unique. This is particularly useful when you need to store a collection without repetitions\n",
        "\n",
        "  2. Fast Membership Testing:-\n",
        "\n",
        "     Sets provide faster membership checks compared to lists.\n",
        "\n",
        "  3. Set Operations:-\n",
        "\n",
        "     Sets support mathematical operations like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference, which can be highly efficient for comparing collections.\n",
        "  4. Unordered Collections: set are unordered collection of data.\n",
        "\n",
        "     When to Use a List Instead:-\n",

        "     Allowing Duplicates:- When duplicate entries are required.\n",
        "\n",
        "     Index-Based Access:- When you need to access elements by their position.\n",
        "\n",
        "     In summary, use a set when you need a collection of unique items, require fast membership testing, or need to perform set-specific operations. Opt for a list when the order, duplicates, or index-based access are essential to your application.​\n",

        "6. What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - ​In Python, a string is a sequence of characters enclosed within single\n",

        "   \n",
        "   Lists: Provide methods for modifying the collection, including .append(), .remove(), .insert(), and .sort().​\n",

        "\n",
        "   Strings: Ideal for representing and manipulating textual data.​\n",
        "   \n",
        "   Lists: Suitable for storing collections of items, especially when the data types are diverse or when modifications to the collection are needed.​\n",
        "   \n",
        "7. How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Tuples in Python are immutable, which means once they are created, their\n",
        "     contents cannot be changed (no adding, removing, or modifying elements). This immutability is the key to how they ensure data integrity.\n",
        "\n",
        "8.  What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "   - A hash table is a data structure that stores key-value pairs. It uses a\n",
        "      hash function to compute an index (called a hash code) into an array where the value is stored.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   - You give it a key (like a name),\n",
        "\n",
        "   - It runs that through a hash function (like a magical code generator),\n",
        "\n",
        "   - And it tells you exactly which locker to find your item in — super fast!\n",
        "     \n",
        "     it relate to dictionaries in Python:-\n",
        "\n",
        "   => In Python, the dictionary (dict) is implemented using a hash table under the hood.\n",
        "     e.g:-   student = {'name:' = 'Ajay', 'age:' = 20}\n",
        "\n",
        "   -  Python hashes the keys \"name\" and \"age\".\n",
        "\n",
        "  -  Then stores the associated values in a hash table at specific locations.\n",
        "\n",
        "9.  Can lists contain different data types in Python?\n",
        "   -  Lists in Python can contain different data types — and that’s one of the\n",
        "     things that makes them super flexible!\n",
        "\n",
        "     e.g:-integer, string, float, boolean, nested list, dictionaryetc.\n",
        "\n",
        "10.  Explain why strings are immutable in Python?\n",
        "    - In Python, strings are immutable, meaning once a string is created, it\n",
        "      cannot be changed. Any operation that seems to modify a string actually creates a new string.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Reasons Why Strings Are Immutable:-\n",
        "     a. Efficiency and Memory Optimization:-\n",
        "    - Strings are stored in interned memory (shared memory) for optimization.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - If strings were mutable, even a small change would require copying the\n",
        "     entire object to avoid affecting others sharing it.\n",
        "\n",
        "     e.g:- a = \"hello\"\n",
        "\n",
        "        b = \"hello\"\n",
        "\n",
        "        print(a is b)  # True — they point to the same object\n",
        "\n",
        "     b.  Hashing Support:-\n",
        "      - Immutable objects can be hashed, meaning they can be used as dictionary keys or in sets.\n",
        "\n",
        "      - If strings were mutable, their hash could change, breaking the hash table system.\n",
        "\n",
        "      e.g:- my_dict = {\"name\": \"Alice\"}  # string \"name\" is used as a key\n",
        "\n",
        "     c. Thread-Safety:-\n",
        "       - Immutability helps avoid unexpected bugs in multi-threaded environments,\n",
        "     because the data can't be modified by another thread once created.\n",
        "\n",
        "     e.g:-\n",
        "         name = \"Alice\"\n",
        "\n",
        "         name[0] = \"M\"  # throw in Error: strings don't support item assignment\n",
        "        \n",
        "        => To \"change\" a string, you have to create a new one:\n",

        "       \n",
        "       Fast Lookups:-\tDictionaries allow O(1) time complexity for key-based access. Lists require O(n) for searching by value.\n",
        "\n",

        "       Descriptive Keys:-\tWith dictionaries, you can use meaningful keys like \"name\" or \"age\" instead of relying on confusing index numbers\n",
        "\n",
        "       Flexible Structure:-\tDictionaries easily handle nested and complex data structures (e.g., JSON-like objects)\n",
        "\n",
        "       Uniqueness:-\tDictionary keys must be unique, which helps prevent duplicate records or confusion.\n",

        "       Better for Data Mapping:-\tIdeal for key-value mapping, like storing settings, user info, or counting occurrences.\n",

        "12.  Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list.\n",
        "    \n",
        "       - Tuples are immutable. Hence, they are primarily used to store data\n",
        "          that doesn't change frequently. Any operation can store data in a tuple when you don't want it to change. Tuples are great to use if you want the data in your collection to be read-only, never to change, and always remain the same and constant\n",

        "13.  How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?\n",
        "       \n",
        "       - Duplicate items are not allowed. If items appear multiple times, only\n",
